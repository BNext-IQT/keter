Keter
~~~~~

Keter (keh-ter) is a highly-scalable lab environment for coronavirus data science. This project 
is informed by lessons learned from past B.Next projects.

The goals of this project:

* Support distributed computing using an architecture based on a job queue and workers. 
* Workers can run on heterogeneous hardware and be started and stopped on demand.
* Support Kubernetes as the first class or preferred orchestration solution.
* Use machine learning techniques that build on state-of-the-art.
* Antiviral subsystem will leverage ChEMBL as much as possible.
* Forecasting UI that is mostly or entirely static and can scale to massive amounts of users.

This project is in the planning phases -- not even pre-alpha.
