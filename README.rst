Keter (keh-ter) is a highly-scalable lab environment for coronavirus data science. This project 
is informed by lessons learned from past B.Next projects.

The goals of this project:

* Support distributed computing using an distributed actor architecture. 
* Agents can run on heterogeneous hardware and be started and stopped on demand.
* Support Kubernetes as the first class or preferred orchestration solution.
* Shared subsystem of models and datasets across all actors.
* Distributed model and data cache that is version controlled.
* Use machine learning techniques that build on state-of-the-art.
* User interfaces that are mostly or entirely static and can scale to massive amounts of users.

This project is pre-alpha.
